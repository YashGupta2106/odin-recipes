    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the Dough</h3><br>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>n a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until the dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li><h3>Preheat the Oven</h3><br>
            Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (usually around 475-500°F or 245-260°C).</li>
        <li><h3>Roll Out the Dough</h3><br>
            Punch down the risen dough and knead it briefly. Roll it out on a floured surface into your desired pizza shape and thickness.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or a baking sheet. If you have a pizza peel, you can assemble the pizza on it for easy transfer to the oven.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Add your desired toppings. Be creative!</li>
            </ol></li>
        <li><h3>Bake the Pizza</h3><br>
            Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven. Bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li><h3> Serve:</h3><br>
            Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve and enjoy your homemade pizza!</li>
